# What is this project?
So back in Fall of 2018, after I finished [ptaskr](https://github.com/pjpollina/ptaskr) and
abandoned the (first iteration of) my Discord bot project, I was a bit strapped for ideas for
projects with my existing skillset, so I read a book on SQL to understand it better. After that
was done, I thought "Hey, I should write a program that uses SQL to gain even *more* knowledge!
That'd be fun!" and thought a simple blogging thing would be the best option, since it'd also be
a good way to gain more web development experience. Then from there I started adding stuff like
CSS and JavaScript stuff and just never really stopped, and now here we are.
